# ColStag

Keyboard project around staggered columns, over a laptop.

# Why ?

Keyboard traditionnal layouts suck. Nothing new here, QWERTY is a remnant from a pre-ergonomy history.

Dvorak-based layouts improve it by reducing how much fingers move, yet key rows are still staggered in contradiction with natural finger orientation.

Luckily, custom desktop keyboards come to the rescue, but as much as I love my ergodox plank:

- forefinger is still more stretched than all other fingers
- columns are still not aligned with fingers
- BÉPO layout has this "W" key beyond the 12th plank column, leading to some remapping cumbersome to get around when using the laptop's keyboard
- the plank does not fit over a laptop keyboard

Whenever one switches from its beloved custom-mapped ortholinear keyboard, to a supremely classic keyboard (laptop or not), one is not happy.

# How ?

1. tilt left and right halfves of the keyboard to align with finger's natural axis (around ±15-20°)
2. shift columns to fit each finger's length
3. add missings keys when compared to QWERTY: "B" and up to "\]"

Useful inspiration on the way:

- [Atreus](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/technomancy/atreus) for tilted halves in one plate (common among others)
- [Catboard](http://catboard.klava.org/) for the extra columns and nice attention to the thinkpad red thing in the middle to avoid touching
- [Kyria](https://splitkb.com/products/kyria-pcb-kit) for thumb key layout and low-profile switch & caps example
- [Keyboardio Model 100](https://shop.keyboard.io/) for the integrated wrist rests
